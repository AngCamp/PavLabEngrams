Chen2020 folder read me

Initially I clusterd just within the chen data.  

There are various images geenrated to mimic the figures in the original plublication

SraRunTable.txt is the official metadata from SRA

counts data is here in the compressed .csv same name as the file from the geo accession.

ClusteringCellsChen.R geenrates the figures and also contains a naive clustering approach.

Chen2020_ClusterMarkers.csv is the result of the seurat clustering which was intedented to 
reproduce the original clustering from the publication.

Seurat numbering has been provided in seurat_clusters_num column, layer markers column
are the clusters containing the laminar specific markers from Chen, note though that
these genes while present as statistically significant markers are not always the top
markers in the cluster.  I also included labels from the top 2 genes which had the largest
avg_log2FC which were also statistically significant after bonferroni correction as per normal
seurat cluster DEG work flow the FindAllMarkers() function.
